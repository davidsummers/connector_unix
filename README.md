Connector to allow discovery of servers (Linux version)

### Compiling
You need to install a couple of dependencies:

```sudo apt install make build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev libboost-system-dev libssl-dev```

Then move into the root directory and execute ```make```.

It should compile fine and generate a file called bridge.

Execute it using ```./bridge```.

Go to your PS3, enter local games mode and search for games.
